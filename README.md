# Low-Code-App-Dev-ILP-Project
This is a Git Hub repo for our Low Code App development ILP project. This Project will be done in two Modules.
Module 1:
This module consist of a user interface based on a subscription model based application,
We need to make an interface for the vendors and the analyst who want to sell their data and functions.
For function by the analyst we need to provide an interface where the analysts can provide their code and a description of their code.
Next up we will make the interface for the end users or the customers who want to purchase the services at their end.
Module 2:
This module would consist of a customisable UI for the end user to analyse the data and apply the functions subscribed earlier.
This project is to be completed in a period of 4 weeks of December month itself.
